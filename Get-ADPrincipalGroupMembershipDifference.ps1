    .DESCRIPTION
        This script compares two AD users group membership and displays only the difference in membership. 
        Only the name of the group will be displayed and will be sorted alphabetically. The SideIndicator 
        indicates which AD user was found in the corresponding AD group. A SideIndicator of <= indicates
        the first AD user is a member. A SideIndicator of => indicates the second AD user is a member. 
        Groups that both users are a part of will not be displayed.
